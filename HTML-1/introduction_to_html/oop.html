        Object-oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in programming.
        Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance,
        hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming.<br /> The main aim of OOP is to bind together
        the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code
        can access this data except that function.
    </p>
    <p>
        The building block of C++ that leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.<br />
        It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member
        functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.<br />
        A class is like a blueprint for an object.

        For Example: Consider the Class of Cars.<br /> There may be many cars with different names
        and brand but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will
        have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.<br /> So here, Car is the class and wheels,
        speed limits, mileage are their properties.<br />

        A Class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member functions.<br />
        Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to
        manipulate these variables and together these data members and member functions
        define the properties and behaviour of the objects in a Class.<br />
        In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage etc
        and member functions can apply brakes, increase speed etc.
