        In C++, RTTI (Run-time type information) is a mechanism that exposes information
        about an object’s data type at runtime and is available only for the classes which
        have at least one virtual function.<br /> It allows the type of an object to be determined
        during program execution.

        In this section, we will see what is the RTTI (Runtime Type Information) in C++.
        In C++ the RTTI is a mechanism, that exposes information about an object’s datatype
        during runtime.<br /> This feature can be available only when the class has at least one
        virtual function. It allows the type of an object to be determined when the program
        is executing.
