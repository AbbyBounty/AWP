        For Example: Consider the Class of Cars.<br /> There may be many cars with different names
        and brand but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will
        have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.<br /> So here, Car is the class and wheels,
        speed limits, mileage are their properties.<br />

        A Class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member functions.<br />
        Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to
        manipulate these variables and together these data members and member functions
        define the properties and behaviour of the objects in a Class.<br />
        In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage etc
        and member functions can apply brakes, increase speed etc.

    <p>
        In this section, we will see what is the RTTI (Runtime Type Information) in C++.
        In C++ the RTTI is a mechanism, that exposes information about an object’s datatype
        during runtime.<br /> This feature can be available only when the class has at least one
        virtual function. It allows the type of an object to be determined when the program
        is executing.

    <a id="exception">Exception Handling</a>
    <p>
        Why Exception Handling?

        Following are main advantages of exception handling over traditional error handling.

        1) Separation of Error Handling code from Normal Code: In traditional error handling
        codes, there are always if else conditions to handle errors. <br />These conditions and the
        code to handle errors get mixed up with the normal flow. This makes the code less
        readable and maintainable. With try catch blocks, the code for error handling becomes
        separate from the normal flow.<br />

        2) Functions/Methods can handle any exceptions they choose: A function can throw many
        exceptions, but may choose to handle some of them. The other exceptions which are
        thrown, but not caught can be handled by caller. If the caller chooses not to catch
        them, then the exceptions are handled by caller of the caller.<br />
        In C++, a function can specify the exceptions that it throws using the throw keyword.
        The caller of this function must handle the exception in some way (either by specifying
        it again or catching it)<br />

        3) Grouping of Error Types: In C++, both basic types and objects can be thrown as
        exception. <br />We can create a hierarchy of exception objects, group exceptions in
        namespaces or classes, categorize them according to types.

    <a id="namespaces">Namespaces</a>
    <p>
        A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers
        (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to
        organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur
        especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.<br /> All identifiers at
        namespace scope are visible to one another without qualification. Identifiers
        outside the namespace can access the members by using the fully qualified name for
        each identifier, for example std::vector<std::string>
            vec;, or else by a using
            Declaration for a single identifier (using std::string), or a using Directive for
            all the identifiers in the namespace (using namespace std;).<br /> Code in header files
            should always use the fully qualified namespace name.
