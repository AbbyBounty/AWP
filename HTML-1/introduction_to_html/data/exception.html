        One of the advantages of C++ over C is Exception Handling. Exceptions are run-time
        anomalies or abnormal conditions that a program encounters during its execution. There
        are two types of exceptions: a)Synchronous, b)Asynchronous(Ex:which are beyond the
        program’s control, Disc failure etc). <br />C++ provides following specialized keywords for
        this purpose.
        try: represents a block of code that can throw an exception.

        catch: represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown.
        throw: Used to throw an exception. Also used to list the exceptions that a function throws, but doesn’t handle itself.

        Why Exception Handling?

        Following are main advantages of exception handling over traditional error handling.

        1) Separation of Error Handling code from Normal Code: In traditional error handling
        codes, there are always if else conditions to handle errors. <br />These conditions and the
        code to handle errors get mixed up with the normal flow. This makes the code less
        readable and maintainable. With try catch blocks, the code for error handling becomes
        separate from the normal flow.<br />

        2) Functions/Methods can handle any exceptions they choose: A function can throw many
        exceptions, but may choose to handle some of them. The other exceptions which are
        thrown, but not caught can be handled by caller. If the caller chooses not to catch
        them, then the exceptions are handled by caller of the caller.<br />
        In C++, a function can specify the exceptions that it throws using the throw keyword.
        The caller of this function must handle the exception in some way (either by specifying
        it again or catching it)<br />

        3) Grouping of Error Types: In C++, both basic types and objects can be thrown as
        exception. <br />We can create a hierarchy of exception objects, group exceptions in
        namespaces or classes, categorize them according to types.
