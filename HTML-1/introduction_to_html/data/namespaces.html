        Namespaces allow us to group named entities that otherwise would have global scope 
        into narrower scopes, giving them namespace scope. This allows organizing the elements
        of programs into different logical scopes referred to by names.<br/>
        Namespace is a feature added in C++ and not present in C.
        A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (names
        of the types, function, variables etc) inside it.<br/>
        Multiple namespace blocks with the same name are allowed. All declarations within 
        those blocks are declared in the named scope.

        A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers 
        (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to
        organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur 
        especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.<br /> All identifiers at 
        namespace scope are visible to one another without qualification. Identifiers
        outside the namespace can access the members by using the fully qualified name for
        each identifier, for example std::vector<std::string> vec;, or else by a using 
        Declaration for a single identifier (using std::string), or a using Directive for
        all the identifiers in the namespace (using namespace std;).<br /> Code in header files 
        should always use the fully qualified namespace name.
