    <p>
        Object-oriented programming – As the name suggests uses objects in programming.
        Object-oriented programming aims to implement<br /> real-world entities like <mark>
            inheritance,hiding, polymorphism
        </mark>, etc in programming.<br /> The main aim of OOP is
        to <b>bind together</b>
        the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code
        can access this data except that function.
    </p>
    <p>
        The building block of C++ that leads to <i>Object-Oriented programming</i> is a Class.<br />
        It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member
        functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class.<br />
        A class is like a <u>blueprint</u> for an object.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        For Example: Consider the Class of Cars.<br /> There may be many cars with different names
        and brand but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will
        have 4 <strong>wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range</strong> etc.<br /> So here, Car is the class and wheels,
        speed limits, mileage are their properties.<br />

        A Class is a user-defined data-type which has data members and member functions.<br />
        Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions used to
        <span style="color:orange">
            manipulate these variables and together these data members and member
            functions
        </span>
        define the properties and behaviour of the objects in a Class.<br />
        In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage etc
        and member functions can apply brakes, increase speed etc.

        One of the advantages of C++ over C is Exception Handling. Exceptions are run-time
        anomalies or abnormal conditions that a program encounters during its execution. There
        are two types of exceptions: a)Synchronous, b)Asynchronous(Ex:which are beyond the
        program’s control, Disc failure etc). <br />C++ provides following specialized keywords for
        this purpose.
        try: represents a block of code that can throw an exception.

        catch: represents a block of code that is executed when a particular exception is thrown.
        throw: Used to throw an exception. Also used to list the exceptions that a function throws, but doesn’t handle itself.

    <a id="exc">Exception Handling</a>
    <p>
        Why Exception Handling?<br />

        Following are main advantages of exception handling over traditional error handling.

        1) Separation of Error Handling code from Normal Code: In traditional error handling
        codes, there are always if else conditions to handle errors. <br />These conditions and the
        code to handle errors get mixed up with the normal flow. This makes the code less
        readable and maintainable. With try catch blocks, the code for error handling becomes
        separate from the normal flow.<br />

        2) Functions/Methods can handle any exceptions they choose: A function can throw many
        exceptions, but may choose to handle some of them. The other exceptions which are
        thrown, but not caught can be handled by caller. If the caller chooses not to catch
        them, then the exceptions are handled by caller of the caller.<br />
        In C++, a function can specify the exceptions that it throws using the throw keyword.
        The caller of this function must handle the exception in some way (either by specifying
        it again or catching it)<br />

        3) Grouping of Error Types: In C++, both basic types and objects can be thrown as
        exception. <br />We can create a hierarchy of exception objects, group exceptions in
        namespaces or classes, categorize them according to types.

    <a id="name">Namespaces</a>
    <p>
        Namespaces allow us to group named entities that otherwise would have global scope
        into narrower scopes, giving them namespace scope. This allows organizing the elements
        of programs into different logical scopes referred to by names.<br />
        Namespace is a feature added in C++ and not present in C.
        A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers (names
        of the types, function, variables etc) inside it.<br />
        Multiple namespace blocks with the same name are allowed. All declarations within
        those blocks are declared in the named scope.
    </p><br />
    <p>
        A namespace is a declarative region that provides a scope to the identifiers
        (the names of types, functions, variables, etc) inside it. Namespaces are used to
        organize code into logical groups and to prevent name collisions that can occur
        especially when your code base includes multiple libraries.<br /> All identifiers at
        namespace scope are visible to one another without qualification. Identifiers
        outside the namespace can access the members by using the fully qualified name for
        each identifier, for example std::vector<std::string>
            vec;, or else by a using
            Declaration for a single identifier (using std::string), or a using Directive for
            all the identifiers in the namespace (using namespace std;).<br /> Code in header files
            should always use the fully qualified namespace name.

    <a id="RTTI">RTTI</a>
    <p>
        In C++, RTTI (Run-time type information) is a mechanism that exposes information
        about an object’s data type at runtime and is available only for the classes which
        have at least one virtual function.<br /> It allows the type of an object to be determined
        during program execution.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this section, we will see what is the RTTI (Runtime Type Information) in C++.
        In C++ the RTTI is a mechanism, that exposes information about an object’s datatype
        during runtime.<br /> This feature can be available only when the class has at least one
        virtual function. It allows the type of an object to be determined when the program
        is executing.
